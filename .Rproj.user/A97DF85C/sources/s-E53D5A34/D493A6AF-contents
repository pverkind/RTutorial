## Load the text:

We can use the `scan()` function to load a text into R. 

`scan()` takes three arguments that are relevant to us: 

* `file` : the path to a local file, or to a URL on the internet
* `what` : tells R how to store the loaded data; in our case, we want it as a string (in R-speak: "character")
* `sep`  : tells R how to split the data into pieces; we will set it to `\n`, 
to split the text into lines

This code will load a text from the OpenITI corpus, assign it to variable `t`,
and print the first 70 lines: 

```{r}
# make sure Arabic is displayed correctly: 
Sys.setlocale(category = "LC_ALL", locale = "C.UTF-8")

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenITI/0425AH/master/data/0401IbnSaburZayyat/0401IbnSaburZayyat.TibbAimma/0401IbnSaburZayyat.TibbAimma.Shia001288-ara1"
t <- scan(url, what="character", sep="\n", encoding="UTF-8")
t[1:50]
```

### Exercise:

In the following script editor (on the left hand side), adapt the script above so that it loads another OpenITI text into a variable called `t_lines`, and print the first 70 lines of that text:

NB: to get the URL for an OpenITI text: 

1. go to the OpenITI corpus search app at [kitab-corpus-metadata.azurewebsites.net/](https://kitab-corpus-metadata.azurewebsites.net/)
2. use the filter field to search for your text
3. find the best version of your text (the one with "PRI" in the `Book Id` column), 
right-click on the book ID in the `Book Id` column, and choose `Copy link address`
in the pop-up menu.

```{r ex="load_text", type="sample-code"}
# make sure Arabic is displayed correctly: 
Sys.setlocale(category = "LC_ALL", locale = "C.UTF-8")

# create a variable `url` and assign the url of your text to it:


# load the text from the url and assign it to a variable called `t_lines`:


# print the first 70 lines of the loaded text:


```

```{r ex="load_text", type="solution"}
# make sure Arabic is displayed correctly: 
Sys.setlocale(category = "LC_ALL", locale = "C.UTF-8")

# create a variable `url` and assign the url of your text to it:
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenITI/0300AH/master/data/0279Baladhuri/0279Baladhuri.FutuhBuldan/0279Baladhuri.FutuhBuldan.Shamela0012221-ara1.completed"

# load the text from the url and assign it to a variable called `t_lines`:
t_lines <- scan(url, what="character", sep="\n", encoding="UTF-8")

# print the first 70 lines of the loaded text:
t_lines[1:70]

```

```{r ex="load_text", type="sct"}
# does not seem to work...
#test_student_typed("t_lines *<-", not_typed_msg  = "You did not assign a value to variable t_lines")
#test_student_typed("url *<-", not_typed_msg  = "You did not assign a value to variable `url`")
#test_student_typed("url *<- *[\"\']", not_typed_msg  = "You did not use quotes when assigning the link to variable `url`")
#test_output_contains("######OpenITI#", incorrect_msg = "Make sure to print `t_lines`.")

#success_msg("Great!")
```
