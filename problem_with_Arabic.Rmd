```{r setup, include=FALSE}
tutorial::go_interactive()
```

If a code section contains any Arabic letter, the creation of the code editor will fail:

```{r}
a <- "ألف"
```

Same example, without the Arabic letters, works:

```{r}
a <- "alif"
Encoding(a)
```

No problem with other non-ASCII characters:

```{r}
a <- "àlíf~"
Encoding(a)
```
